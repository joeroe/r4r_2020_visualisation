# R for Archaeologists: Visualisation

This repository contains the slides and source code for a workshop on visualisation in R, part of the 'R for Archaeologists' (R4R) winter school held at the University of Pisa on:

* 27th January – 7th February 2020
* 25th January – 5th February 2021

The slides use `remark.js` and are generated from an RMarkdown file using the [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package. 
You may find it useful to look at the RMarkdown file to see the R code for some of the examples.

## How to view the slides
